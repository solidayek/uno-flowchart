# uno-flowchart
it was created in AP CSP

Students will make a flowchart for playing the card game UNO. This should at least include the following events:

 


What card to play
How many cards to draw
What to do if someone says “UNO!”
What to do if you play a Wild card
How you know if someone won


 

When the groups have finished, have certain flowcharts displayed and critiqued for completeness.

 

The rules will be based on the game, and not on modified versions of the game of Uno.
